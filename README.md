## What is MusicSelector
 If you download a lot of music, and you don't know if you will like it all and you need to select your favorites, this tool can help you. You just need to select your music download folder where all the albums are located, then select a destination/favorites folder where you will want to store your favorite albums from the download store previously mentioned.
 
 
## Instructions
- Go to Releases and download the last .rar, unzip it, and install.


## Notes for developers
Sorry, but for now the code is messy af.
